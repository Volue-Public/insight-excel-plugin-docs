This is the step-by-step guide on how to use our Excel add-in.

***********************
Step 1: Open the add-in
***********************

* Open Microsoft Excel 2021 or latest, Ms Office 365 Excel on Windows or Microsoft Excel Online (supported versions).

* Earlier Office versions will not be supported from October 2025. Please upgrade either to perpetual Office 2021 (or later) or to a Microsoft 365 account.

* We are aware of some issues with Office on Mac and recommend that you use other platforms.

* Go to Insert menu item. Click on 'My Add-ins'. A pop-up will appear with all of your Office Add-ins.

* If it is the first time using it, go to Store and search by Volue Insight API. Click add.

.. warning::
    We have encounter problems with versionÂ 16.0.11629 or higher of Office combined with the version 1903 of Windows. The fix has been release by Microsoft and it is now available on the new version of Office. This version is now available on the Monthly update channel. If you do not have this update channel follow the tutorial on our :ref:`Troubleshooting <troubleshooting>` section.

**************************************
Step 2: Setting up the search criteria
**************************************

Use search filters
=====================

* When you first open the add-in there are some pre-defined search filters: Areas, Categories and Sources.

* You can type search after an option:

* You can add options in different filters. This should help narrow down your search:

* In the search settings you can change which search filters you would like to use. You can change each search filters search behaviour (if you want them to behave like **AND** or **OR**), and also which date and time formats you would like to use. You can also reset it to default by clicking the **RESET TO DEFAULT** button on the bottom of the view.

Use the search field
====================
* You can also use the search text field to search after curves. This way you can be very specific if you know exactly which curve you are looking for.
